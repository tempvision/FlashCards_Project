        However, that is not the case. The issue here is that most developers <br>

        Well, since the statement var a = b = 3; is shorthand for the statements b = 3; and var a = b;<br>
        b ends up being a global variable (since it is not preceded by the var keyword) <br>

        1<br>
        4<br>
        3<br>
        2<br>
        Let’s first explain the parts of this that are presumably more obvious:<br>
        <br>
        1 and 4 are displayed first since they are logged by simple calls to console.log() without any delay<br>
        <br>
        2 is displayed after 3 because 2 is being logged after a delay of 1000 msecs <br>
        (i.e., 1 second) whereas 3 is being logged after a delay of 0 msecs.<br>
        OK, fine. But if 3 is being logged after a delay of 0 msecs, <br>
        doesn’t that mean that it is being logged right away? And, if so, <br>
        shouldn’t it be logged before 4, since 4 is being logged by a later line of code?<br>
        The answer has to do with properly understanding JavaScript events and timing.<br>      
        The browser has an event loop which checks the event queue and processes pending events.<br>
         For example, if an event happens in the background (e.g., a script onload event) <br>
        while the browser is busy (e.g., processing an onclick), <br>
        the event gets appended to the queue. When the onclick handler is complete, <br>
        the queue is checked and the event is then handled (e.g., the onload script is executed).<br>
        Similarly, setTimeout() also puts execution of its referenced function into the event queue if the browser is busy.<br>
        
        When a value of zero is passed as the second argument to setTimeout(), <br>
        it attempts to execute the specified function “as soon as possible”. <br>
        Specifically, execution of the function is placed on the event queue to occur on the next timer tick. <br>
        Note, though, that this is not immediate; the function is not executed until the next tick. <br>
        That’s why in the above example, the call to console.log(4) occurs before the call to console.log(3)<br>
         (since the call to console.log(3) is invoked via setTimeout, so it is slightly delayed).`,

        longDescription: `The output of this code will be 456 (not 123).

        The reason for this is as follows: When setting an object property, <br>
        JavaScript will implicitly stringify the parameter value. <br>
        In this case, since b and c are both objects, they will both be converted to "[object Object]". <br>
        As a result, a[b] anda[c] are both equivalent to a["[object Object]"] and can be used interchangeably. <br>
        Therefore, setting or referencing a[c] is precisely the same as setting or referencing a[b].`,

        question: `How do you make a deep clone of an object in JS?`,
        longDescription: `var obj = {a: 1 ,b: 2}<br>
        var objclone = Object.assign({},obj);<br>
        Now the value of objclone is {a: 1 ,b: 2} but points to a different object than obj.    <br>   
        Note the potential pitfall, though: Object.clone() will just do a shallow copy, not a deep copy.<br>
         This means that nested objects aren’t copied.`,
