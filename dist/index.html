            <p>A flashcard or flash card is a card bearing information, as words or numbers, on either or both sides,
                used in classroom drills or in private study. One writes a question on a side and an answer overleaf.
                Flashcards can bear vocabulary, historical dates, formulae or any subject matter that can be learned
                via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards are widely used as a learning drill to aid memorization.
                <br>
                They are often associated with spaced repetition, i.e. reviewed at expanding time intervals. Flashcards
                can be virtual, as those used by flashcard software, or physical. Flashcards are an application of the
                testing effect âˆ’ the finding that long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is
                devoted to retrieving the information through testing with proper feedback. </p>
